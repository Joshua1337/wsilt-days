# What should I listen to?

## Contribute
If you want to add a song just edit the corresponding .json-file and add the songs information filled in the following template:
```json
    {
        "name": "{name}",
        "artist": "{artist}",
        "spotify_id": "{spotify_id}"
    }
```

Alternatively you can simply open an issue and I'll add that song for you.
