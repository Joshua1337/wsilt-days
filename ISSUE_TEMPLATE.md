Hey,

I would like to add a song to ***day***.

* **Name:**
* **Artist:**
* **Spotify ID or URI:**

> **Hint:** You can find the Spotify ID by right-clicking on a song (in Spotify, of course) and then clicking on "Copy Spotify URI". If you can't manage to copy it, that's just fine. Hopefully I can do that for you!
